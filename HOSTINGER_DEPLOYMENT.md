## 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Repository Setup on Hostinger

1. Log in to Hostinger Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Hosting → Git**
3. Click **Connect Repository**
4. Select GitHub and authorize
5. Choose `live-clinic-queue-&-token-management-system` repository
6. Select `main` branch
7. Click **Connect**

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Go to **Hosting → Environment Variables** and set:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=<Hostinger-provided application port>
BACKEND_PORT=<same port as PORT for the unified server>
DB_HOST=<hostinger-mysql-host>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=<hostinger-mysql-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-database-password>
DB_NAME=<hostinger-mysql-database>
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<strong-bootstrap-password-at-least-12-characters>
SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME=<unique-production-super-admin-email>
CLINIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<strong-seed-password-at-least-12-characters>
DOCTOR_PASSWORD=<strong-seed-password-at-least-12-characters>
STAFF_PASSWORD=<strong-seed-password-at-least-12-characters>
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Change `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a strong, unique password before deploying!

Optional variables:
```
DEBUG_MODE=false
SESSION_SECRET=<long-random-secret>
SESSION_MAX_AGE=28800
TRUST_PROXY=true
```

`SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME` must not reuse a clinic account such as `admin@clinic.local`. The seeded clinic administrator remains a `CLINIC_ADMIN`; use a separate production super-admin identity.

### Step 3: Build Configuration

Set in Hostinger deployment settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm ci && npm run build
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
npm run start
```

**Build Output:** `dist/` and `dist-server/` (both are required by `npm run start`)

**Root Directory:** `/`

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click **Deploy**
2. Wait for build to complete (typically 3-5 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for errors
4. Access site at your Hostinger domain

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check if app is running
curl https://your-domain/api/health

# Check server status
curl https://your-domain/api/status
```

### Test Login
- Navigate to app login page
- Use the super-admin email configured in `SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME` and the corresponding bootstrap password.

### Test Database
- Check if patient data can be created
- Verify clinic information is saved
- Confirm database persists between requests

- No hardcoded credentials

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### Database
- MySQL is configured with `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME`.
- Run `npm run db:migrate` before the first deployment.
- Queue and patient history older than the current day is automatically removed.
- Authentication uses signed expiring cookies shared across instances. Keep the same long random `SESSION_SECRET` on every instance.
- Rate-limit counters are stored in MySQL and are initialized by `npm run db:migrate`.
- Back up MySQL regularly for production data.

### Seed Accounts
`npm run db:seed` is restricted to disposable non-production databases. It inserts demo accounts and must not be run against production.

| Email | Environment password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| admin@clinic.local | `CLINIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | CLINIC_ADMIN |
| doctor@clinic.local | `DOCTOR_PASSWORD` | DOCTOR |
| staff@clinic.local | `STAFF_PASSWORD` | STAFF |
| superadmin@clinic.local | `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | SUPER_ADMIN |


### Ports
- Unified server: the exact `PORT` supplied by Hostinger
- Single unified server running both

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (must be 18+)
- Verify all dependencies: `npm list`
- Check Hostinger build logs

### App Won't Start
- Verify `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set
- Check database permissions
- Review Hostinger error logs

### Login Issues
- Verify credentials and environment variables
- Check that MySQL migrations completed successfully
- Enable `DEBUG_MODE=true` temporarily for logs

### Database Errors
- Verify MySQL host, credentials, database name, and permissions
- Run `npm run db:migrate` from the release environment
- Check available database connections and Hostinger logs
